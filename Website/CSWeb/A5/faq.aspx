<i class="icon-plus"></i> Who is GOLO?</a>
<div id="faq1" class="collapse">
<div class="faq_answer"><p>GOLO was developed by a team of doctors who discovered that in order to lose weight permanently, controlling insulin was more important than controlling calories, and therefore focused on a solution to reversing Insulin Resistance. Most diets cause excessive muscle loss, slowing the metabolism and making weight loss harder and weight gain easier. The GOLO team spent five years developing and testing a proprietary blend of all natural ingredients to control insulin and promote fat loss, and a patented insulin control eating plan that allows dieters to lose weight without starving and sacrificing their health. The GOLO team is very proud of the GOLO program, and we are committed to helping you reach your goals.</p>

<a class="faq-question" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#faq_list" href="#faq5"><i class="icon-plus"></i> What makes GOLO unique?</a>
<div id="faq5" class="collapse">
<div class="faq_answer"><p>Unlike most weight loss programs, GOLO addresses the real cause of weight gain: Insulin Resistance. GOLO provides a safe, natural solution for reversing Insulin Resistance so you lose weight permanently while speeding up your metabolism. Additionally, the added benefits of following GOLO are improved health, lowering the risks of getting heart disease and diabetes, and the ability to reduce and/or eliminate medications.</p>

<div class="faq-group">
<a class="faq-question" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#faq_list" href="#faq6"><i class="icon-plus"></i> What is Insulin Resistance and how does it develop?</a>
<div id="faq6" class="collapse">
<div class="faq_answer"><p>Insulin Resistance is a condition during which normal amounts of insulin are no longer sufficient to satisfy the body’s insulin requirements. To compensate, the body responds by producing more insulin, causing blood insulin levels to rise. Insulin stimulates the production of fat as well as blocks the release of fat from your fat cells. When excess fat is present, fat cells assume a hormonal function and start to manufacture various chemical substances called ‘inflammatory cytokines’. For various reasons, some of these inflammatory cytokines disrupt insulin’s role and renders it less effective.<br>
<br>
Because of insulin’s obesity promoting effects, the elevation of insulin levels makes one more prone to gaining weight. In addition, higher insulin levels also make it more difficult to lose weight. Once this condition sets in, a vicious cycle begins, explaining why many overweight people find that their metabolism has effectively slowed.</p>

<div class="faq-group">
<a class="faq-question" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#faq_list" href="#faq7"><i class="icon-plus"></i> How is my metabolism affected by Insulin Resistance?</a>
<div id="faq7" class="collapse">
<div class="faq_answer"><p>A slow metabolism and Insulin Resistance are directly related. Insulin is the main controlling influence of metabolism. Insulin Resistance causes your body to store fat easier and faster. The higher your fat percentage, the slower your metabolism is, as your body becomes less efficient at converting food into energy. To speed up your metabolism you must optimize insulin and lower your body fat percentage.</p>

<a class="faq-question" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#faq_list" href="#faq8"><i class="icon-plus"></i> What kind of results can I expect from using GOLO?</a>
<div id="faq8" class="collapse">
<div class="faq_answer"><p>In addition to reversing Insulin Resistance, you can expect to lose an average of 1 to 2 pounds of fat per week, possibly more depending on how much you need to lose. Additionally, you will see a noticeable difference quickly in how your clothes fit better, and other positive changes like increased energy, better sleep and other health improvements. See Proven Results and Success Stories for more information on the results you can expect.</p>

<div class="faq-group">
<a class="faq-question" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#faq_list" href="#faq9"><i class="icon-plus"></i> How long does it take to see results?</a>
<div id="faq9" class="collapse">
<div class="faq_answer"><p>The time it takes to see results depends on how much weight you have to lose and the severity of your Insulin Resistance. Remember, it’s not just about weight! Other positive changes like feeling better, sleeping better, and clothes fitting differently are all good results! GOLO is not a short-term fix. Think about how long it took to put the weight on, and what your past dieting habits may have done to your body. The Rescue Pak supplements and the Metabolic Fuel Matrix both work to boost your metabolism and reverse Insulin Resistance so your body can burn fat, permanently.</p>

<a class="faq-question" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#faq_list" href="#faq13"><i class="icon-plus"></i> Do I need to exercise?</a>
<div id="faq13" class="collapse">
<div class="faq_answer"><p>You can still lose weight and reduce Insulin Resistance with GOLO if you don’t exercise, but exercise is something everyone needs to do. In addition to weight loss and increasing the metabolism, exercise relieves stress, increases mood and energy, helps rid the body of toxins, and can even improve digestion. Exercise also reduces your risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes.<br>

<div class="faq_answer"><p>The Rescue Pak helps accelerate weight loss.
In GOLO studies, 32 participants tried GOLO with the supplements and without (just following the Metabolic Fuel Matrix and given a placebo).

<a class="faq-question" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#faq_list" href="#faq19"><i class="icon-plus"></i> Are the supplements safe to take with medications?</a>
<div id="faq19" class="collapse">
<div class="faq_answer"><p>GOLO supplements can be safely taken with most prescription medications, including diabetic drugs.

We do not recommend that you change or stop any medications without consulting your doctor.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Please note: </strong>Caution should be taken with all classes of oral anti-diabetic medication, particularly when taking GOLO Release, as the blood sugar lowering effect of Release may lower your blood sugar. Therefore, dosage adjustments of your prescriptions may be required. Please consult your doctor should this occur. Release should always be taken during a main meal, and not with snacks.

<div class="faq_answer"><p>The Rescue Pak supplements are safe for long-term use and you may take them as long as you like.
