  It is the express intent of the parties that the Terms and Conditions and all related documents have been drawn up in English.</p>
<p> <strong>Applicable Law and Venue</strong><br>
  These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado, without resort to its conflict of law provisions. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to the Terms and Conditions or your use of the Sites shall be filed only in the Superior Court of Denver County, Colorado, or the United States District Court for the Central District of Colorado, and except as stated herein you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action, or proceeding arising out of the Terms and Conditions. Notwithstanding the above, any controversy or claim related to this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively by arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9, U. S. Code) (the &quot;Act&quot;). The Act will apply even though this Agreement provides that it is governed by the laws of Colorado. Arbitration proceedings will be determined in accordance with the Act, the rules and procedures for the arbitration of financial services disputes of JAMS/Endispute, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company or any successor thereof (&quot;JAMS&quot;), except that discovery in said arbitration shall be limited in scope to the specifics of liability on the Claim, and any discovery related to damages calculations or any financials shall be withheld until after liability has been decided by the arbitrator(s). In the event of any inconsistency between the JAMS rules and this paragraph, the terms of this paragraph shall control. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS and conducted in Denver, Colorado. All Claims shall be determined by one arbitrator; however, if Claims exceed Five Million Dollars, upon the request of either Brainetics or You, the Claims shall be decided by three arbitrators. All arbitration hearings shall commence within ninety (90) days of the demand for arbitration and close within ninety (90) days of commencement and the award of the arbitrator(s) shall be issued within thirty (30) days of the close of the hearing. However, the arbitrator(s), upon a showing of good cause, may extend the commencement of the hearing for up to an additional sixty (60) days. The arbitrator(s) shall provide a concise written statement of reasons for the award. The arbitration award may be submitted to any court having jurisdiction to be confirmed and enforced. The arbitrator(s) will have the authority to decide whether any Claim is barred by the statute of limitations and, if so, to dismiss the arbitration on that basis. For purposes of the application of the statute of limitations, the service on JAMS under applicable JAMS rules of a notice of Claim is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit. Any dispute concerning this arbitration provision or whether a Claim is arbitrable shall be determined by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) shall have the power to award legal fees pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. This paragraph does not limit the right of Brainetics to: (i) exercise self-help remedies, such as, but not limited to, setoff; (ii) initiate judicial or non-judicial foreclosure against any real or personal property collateral; (iii) exercise any judicial or power of sale rights, or (iv) act in a court of law to obtain an interim remedy, such as, but not limited to, injunctive relief, writ of possession or appointment of a receiver, or additional or supplementary remedies. The prevailing party in any action or arbitration related to these Terms and Conditions shall be entitled to its reasonable attorney fees and costs.</p>
<p> The terms of this section survive any termination of the Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p><strong>General</strong><br>
  The Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between Brainetics and you with respect to your use of the Sites, your purchase of products and services through the Sites, and as applicable any products or services of Brainetics. Any cause of action you may have with respect to the Sites or Brainetics products or services must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises, notwithstanding any statutes of limitation to the contrary. Any failure by Brainetics to enforce or exercise any provision of the Terms and Conditions or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. The section titles used in the Terms and Conditions are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect. Nothing in these Terms and Conditions will be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and Brainetics, and you do not have any authority to create any obligation or make any representation on Brainetics’s behalf. You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations of these Terms and Conditions, by operation of law or otherwise, without Brainetics’s written consent. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms and Conditions will be binding on, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable against you and Brainetics and their respective successors and assigns.</p>
<p> The terms of this section survive any termination of the Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Other important terms</strong><br>
  These Terms and Conditions supersede any other terms and conditions previously published by us and any other representations or statements made by us to you, whether oral, written, or otherwise. We may assign, transfer, or sub-contract any of our rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions to any third party at our discretion. No delay by us in exercising any right or remedy under these Terms and Conditions shall operate as waiver of that right or remedy or shall affect our ability to subsequently exercise that right or remedy. Any waiver must be agreed by us in writing.</p>
