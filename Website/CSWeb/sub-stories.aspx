									<p>Brainetics shows that numbers aren't simply boring old numbers. They are there to be manipulated and twisted into brainteasers and tricks that will entertain you and those around you. Numbers ARE fun. My son enjoyed and continues to enjoy the Brainetics system. Mike Byster, you are my hero. Thank you for coming up with something that keeps kids excited about being SMART.</p>

									<p>I would recommend Brainetics for anyone whose kids are average to better performers in math and are looking for a way to boost their learning skills. Most of all I enjoy Bysters enthusiasm for learning, his believe that anyone can master his skills, and for his urging to "think outside the box." One thing is certain- he got my two daughters to enjoy math, if only for a short while. Now, that's a cool party trick.</p>

									<p>Hi Mike,</p>
									<p>Thank you for the course Brainetics. This was the best continuing education money I have spent. I was impressed with your teaching methods. I am a finance manager loan advisor so I was good with numbers but knowing these little things are really cool and add to my effectiveness. My intention was to see if I could learn it and teach it to my nieces and nephews that are in school and wow what a great thing you have done here. I tell everybody about your program and give them your website so they can order and to nudge them I let them test me against their calculator and they look in awe of the speed I can get the answers. It is so fun to do this course I work to improve everyday thanks again. </p>
									<p>Make It A Great Day!</p>

									<p>Thank you Mike! You are changing lives -- both young and not-so-young.</p>

									<p>Hello,</p>
									<p>We have been doing the program through out the summer months with our children and I have found that it is a great program. The kids think it is fun and they do not realize that they are actually learning until they finally get it and notice that it has all fallen into place and they got the answer right. I would love to see this program in all the schools and was hoping that maybe we could have a demonstration at our school for the parents and the kids. </p>
									<p>Thank you so much for such a great program.</p>

									<p>Brainetics is used school-wide on enrichment days to promote critical thinking and problem solving skills that have a definite positive impact! Through quick tricks, short cuts and memory tricks students are able to increase their computational speed, figure out challenging problems but more importantly display higher self-esteem!!</p>

									<p>I am a first grade teacher at Fair Haven Grade School in Fair Haven, Vermont. I must say that I am very impressed with this Brainetics program that you have developed. I can envision every child becoming a successful learner in mathematics. The concept of engaging both brain hemispheres simultaneously has been proven to show a greater increase in learning. The goal is to develop more pathways in the brain so more learning can happen. By doing this, we not only increase our knowledge with math, but within other subject areas too. Just the self-confidence alone that is built within the children, gives them hope.</p>

									<p>"Michael Byster came to our district three years ago offering to work with our students on a volunteer basis. He quickly proved himself to be an asset to our school curriculum as well as to our students. &hellip; The students love working with him for a variety of reasons. To begin with, he helps them feel good about themselves. He preaches "never giving up" and stresses to the kids that they can do anything if they put their mind to it. He also challenges them to use their brain in ways not covered in most math curriculums. Finally, he teaches them the value of giving and sharing your gifts with a community."</p>

Your techniques and capabilities are impressive; however, far more impressive is your devotion to making learning fun and accessible for all learners. Your enthusiasm, passion, and love for learning are infectious. The kindness you have shown us by presenting your two-hour workshop without cost or fee will not soon be forgotten. The tools and inspiration with which you have left us will permeate our teaching for years to come.
