                                The biggest benefit is the confidence my son now has about math. If you have a child who is struggling in math, giving them Brainetics is one of the smartest things you can do for them, and yourself.

                                I think Brainetics would make a fantastic homeschool purchase. Not only is it educational, but a fun DVD/Game to watch. It'll definitely exercise <span class="iblock">your mind.</span>

                                This is the first time ever that a teacher hasn't expressed concern over my daughter's apparent fear and loathing over math testing. That alone is worth its weight in gold... I just want her to like the process of learning.
